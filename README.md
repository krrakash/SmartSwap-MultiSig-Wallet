# SmartSwap-MultiSig-Wallet

Problem Statement:
In decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain environments, multi-signature wallets are used to ensure that multiple parties must approve a transaction before it can be executed. These wallets help provide enhanced security and transparency, especially for organizations, DAOs, and groups that manage shared funds or assets.

However, managing multiple tokens and ensuring sufficient token balances can be challenging, especially when transactions require specific assets (like Wrapped Ether, WETH) that are not always readily available in the wallet. In particular, on Polygon or other EVM chains, the native token (e.g., MATIC on Polygon) is often held in the wallet, but certain transactions require WETH or other ERC-20 tokens.

This presents a challenge:

Manual Token Swaps: Users need to manually swap native tokens (like MATIC) for WETH before executing a transaction, which adds complexity and can cause delays.
Inefficiency in Fund Management: Without automation, the wallet needs to hold different token balances (e.g., both MATIC and WETH), which can be inefficient and cumbersome.
Solution:
This Multi-Signature Wallet with Uniswap V3 Auto Swap addresses the problem by automatically swapping native tokens (MATIC) for Wrapped Ether (WETH) using Uniswap V3 whenever required for a transaction. This eliminates the need for manual token swaps and ensures that the wallet always has enough WETH to execute transactions that require it.

Features:
Multi-Signature Functionality: The wallet requires multiple owner confirmations to execute a transaction, ensuring secure and transparent fund management.
Supports Multiple Token Standards: The wallet can handle transfers of:
ETH / MATIC (native tokens),
ERC-20 tokens,
ERC-721 tokens (NFTs),
ERC-1155 tokens (multi-token standard).
Uniswap V3 Auto Swap: If the wallet lacks sufficient WETH to complete a transaction, it will automatically swap the required amount of MATIC to WETH using Uniswap V3.
Seamless Transactions: Users can submit transactions, and the contract will ensure that sufficient WETH is available by performing token swaps before executing the transaction.
Use Cases:
Decentralized Organizations (DAOs): Groups managing shared funds can use this multi-signature wallet to ensure secure transactions, with the added convenience of automatic token swaps.
Multi-Owner Wallets: Projects and organizations with multiple owners can use this wallet to securely manage funds across different token standards and ensure that necessary tokens are always available.
Fund Management on EVM Chains: For users working on chains like Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, or Avalanche, this wallet simplifies the management of native tokens and ERC-20 tokens like WETH, reducing the need for manual interventions.
How It Works:
Transaction Submission: Owners submit a transaction that requires WETH or other tokens.
Automatic Swap: If the wallet doesnâ€™t have enough WETH, it swaps MATIC for WETH using Uniswap V3.
Confirmation Process: Once enough owners confirm the transaction, it can be executed.
Transaction Execution: The wallet completes the transaction using the swapped WETH, or other tokens as required.
Benefits:
Security: The multi-signature process ensures that funds can only be transferred when a majority of owners approve.
Efficiency: The automatic swap feature reduces manual intervention, making the process smoother and faster.
Token Flexibility: The wallet can handle various types of token transfers (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155) and manage native tokens (like MATIC) more efficiently.
This smart contract simplifies the management of assets for multi-owner wallets on EVM-compatible chains, while adding the convenience of automated token swaps through Uniswap V3.
